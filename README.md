# Gaming Platform Project

This project is an example of a gaming platform designed to enhance player experience, ensure fair play, and provide real-time data analytics. The platform includes various services such as game telemetry, scoring, bot detection, and an administration dashboard. Each service is designed to handle specific aspects of the gaming environment, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for players and administrators alike.

## Services

### Game Telemetry Websocket Service

Real-time telemetry and data analytics are crucial for enhancing player experience and game performance. The Game Telemetry Web Sockets service provides a solution for capturing and transmitting live game data using WebSocket technology. By integrating this service, game developers can monitor player actions, detect anomalies, and gather valuable insights into gameplay dynamics. This real-time data transmission ensures that game administrators can make informed decisions quickly, improving game balance and player satisfaction. The service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games, where immediate feedback and data-driven adjustments are essential for maintaining a competitive and engaging environment.

### Scoring Service

Accurately tracking and updating player scores in real-time is essential for maintaining competitive gameplay and enhancing player engagement. The Scoring service provides a solution for calculating and managing game scores using a stateful data processing approach. By consuming game telemetry data, this service dynamically updates player scores based on in-game events, such as apples eaten in a Snake game. The integration with Kafka ensures seamless data flow and real-time score updates, allowing game administrators to monitor player performance and make data-driven decisions. This service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games, where real-time score tracking is crucial for maintaining a fair and competitive environment.

### Administration Dashboard

Having a comprehensive and user-friendly admin dashboard is essential for monitoring game performance and player behavior. The Dashboard service provides a way for game administrators to view game scores, detect cheaters, and analyze player data. By connecting to a Redis database, this service aggregates and displays key metrics, allowing for quick identification of top players and potential cheaters. The intuitive interface, built with Flask, ensures that administrators can easily navigate through the data, making informed decisions to enhance the gaming experience. This service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games, where maintaining a fair and competitive environment is crucial for player satisfaction and retention.

### Snake Game

Providing an engaging and interactive experience is key to player retention and satisfaction. The Snake Game with Autopilot and Telemetry offers a modern twist on the classic game, incorporating real-time telemetry and autopilot mode to simulate cheater gameplay. By leveraging a Flask web gateway to publish game data to a Kafka topic via HTTP POST requests, this game ensures seamless data integration and real-time updates. The intuitive mobile controls and responsive design make it accessible on various devices, while the telemetry data provides valuable insights into player behavior and game performance.

### WebSocket Server

Real-time data transmission is essential for enhancing player experience and game performance. The WebSocket Server service provides a solution for subscribing to data streams and transmitting them to WebSocket clients. By integrating this service, game developers can ensure seamless data flow and real-time updates, allowing for immediate feedback and interaction. This service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games, where real-time communication and data-driven adjustments are crucial for maintaining a competitive and engaging environment. The WebSocket Server service ensures that game administrators can monitor and respond to player actions in real-time, improving overall game performance and player satisfaction.

### Cheater Sink Service

Maintaining a fair and competitive environment is essential for player satisfaction and retention. The Cheater Sink Service is designed to enhance the integrity of the gaming platform by efficiently detecting and storing information about cheaters. By consuming data from a Kafka topic and persisting it to a Redis database, this service ensures that cheater data is readily available for analysis and action. Integrating this solution into gaming infrastructure can help quickly identify and mitigate cheating behavior, thereby improving the overall user experience and maintaining a level playing field for all players. This service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games where cheating can significantly disrupt game balance and player enjoyment.

### Data Normalization Service

Data normalization is crucial for ensuring consistency and accuracy across different systems and platforms. The Data Normalization Service provides a solution for standardizing and cleaning data from various sources, making it easier to integrate and analyze. By consuming data from a Kafka topic, this service could apply normalization techniques to ensure consistent data formats, removing duplicates, and correct inconsistencies. This standardization is essential for building a comprehensive player profile, enabling data-driven decision-making and enhancing player experience. The service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games, where data from multiple sources needs to be harmonized for effective analytics and player targeting.

### Bot Detection Service

Detecting cheaters is crucial for maintaining a fair and competitive environment. This bot detection service leverages a machine learning model to analyze player behavior in real-time, identifying patterns indicative of bot and cheater activity. By consuming telemetry data from game sessions, applying feature extraction techniques, and utilizing a pre-trained model, this service can flag potential cheaters. This solution can enhance the integrity of your game, ensuring a level playing field for all players and improving overall user experience. This service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games where cheating can significantly impact the game's balance and player satisfaction.
