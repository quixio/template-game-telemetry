# Data Normalization Service

In the gaming industry, data normalization is crucial for ensuring consistency and accuracy across different systems and platforms. The Data Normalization Service provides a solution for standardizing and cleaning data from various sources, making it easier to integrate and analyze. By consuming data from a Kafka topic, this service could apply normalization techniques to ensure consistent data formats, removing duplicates, and correct inconsistencies. This standardization is essential for building a comprehensive player profile, enabling data-driven decision-making and enhancing player experience. The service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games, where data from multiple sources needs to be harmonized for effective analytics and player targeting.
