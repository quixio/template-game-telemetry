# Scoring Service

In the gaming industry, accurately tracking and updating player scores in real-time is essential for maintaining competitive gameplay and enhancing player engagement. The Scoring service provides a solution for calculating and managing game scores using a stateful data processing approach. By consuming game telemetry data, this service dynamically updates player scores based on in-game events, such as apples eaten in a Snake game. The integration with Kafka ensures seamless data flow and real-time score updates, allowing game administrators to monitor player performance and make data-driven decisions. This service is particularly beneficial for online multiplayer games, where real-time score tracking is crucial for maintaining a fair and competitive environment.
